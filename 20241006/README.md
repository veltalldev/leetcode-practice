# Problem: Rotate Linked List

## Description

Given a linked list and a positive integer `k`, rotate the list to the right by `k` places.

### Example 1:

Given the linked list:

`7 -> 7 -> 3 -> 5`

and `k = 2`, the list should become:

`3 -> 5 -> 7 -> 7`

### Example 2:

Given the linked list:

`1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5`

and `k = 3`, the list should become:

`3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 1 -> 2`
