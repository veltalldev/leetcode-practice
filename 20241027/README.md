# Stack Interleaving Problem Definition

## Problem Statement
Given a stack of N elements, implement an algorithm to interleave the first half of the stack with the second half reversed using only one additional queue as auxiliary storage. The transformation must be done in-place, modifying the original stack.

## Constraints
1. **Data Structures Available:**
   - Original stack (input/output)
   - One queue for auxiliary storage
   
2. **Allowed Operations:**
   - Stack: push(element), pop()
   - Queue: enqueue(element), dequeue()

3. **Memory Requirements:**
   - Must be done in-place using only the auxiliary queue
   - No additional data structures allowed

## Input/Output Examples

### Example 1: Odd number of elements
```
Input stack:  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] (top at right)
Output stack: [1, 5, 2, 4, 3] (top at right)

Process visualization:
Original:     1, 2, 3, 4, 5
Split:        (1, 2, 3) and (4, 5)
Reversed 2nd: (1, 2, 3) and (5, 4)
Interleaved:  1, 5, 2, 4, 3
```

### Example 2: Even number of elements
```
Input stack:  [1, 2, 3, 4] (top at right)
Output stack: [1, 4, 2, 3] (top at right)

Process visualization:
Original:     1, 2, 3, 4
Split:        (1, 2) and (3, 4)
Reversed 2nd: (1, 2) and (4, 3)
Interleaved:  1, 4, 2, 3
```

## Expected Behavior
1. If the stack is empty or has one element, return it unchanged
2. For N elements:
   - First half: elements 1 to ⌈N/2⌉
   - Second half: elements ⌈N/2⌉+1 to N (reversed)
3. Preserve the relative order of first half elements
4. Reverse the relative order of second half elements
5. Interleave elements maintaining first half elements at odd positions

## Technical Requirements
1. Solution must handle both even and odd number of elements
2. Must work with any data type that can be stored in a stack
3. Must maintain stack and queue ADT operation restrictions
4. Should handle edge cases gracefully (empty stack, single element)

## Efficiency Considerations
- Time Complexity: Solution should strive for optimal efficiency given the constraints
- Space Complexity: Limited to O(n) due to the auxiliary queue requirement
- Operation Count: Consider minimizing the total number of push/pop/enqueue/dequeue operations

## Success Criteria
1. Correct interleaving of elements according to the pattern
2. In-place modification of original stack
3. Use of only one auxiliary queue
4. Handling of all edge cases
5. Adherence to data structure operation restrictions
