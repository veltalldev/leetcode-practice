# Problem: Division of Two Positive Integers Without Division, Multiplication, or Modulus

## Problem Statement:
Implement the **division** of two positive integers without using the division (`/`), multiplication (`*`), or modulus (`%`) operators. 

You should return the **quotient** as an integer, ignoring the remainder.

### Example:
**Input**:
```plaintext
dividend = 10, divisor = 3
```
**Output**:
```plaintext
3
```
