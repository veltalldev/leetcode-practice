### Finding Islands in a 2D Grid (DFS for Connected Components)

Given a `m x n` 2D grid map of `1`s (land) and `0`s (water), return the number of islands. An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

#### Example:
Input: `grid = [[1,1,0,0,0],[1,1,0,0,0],[0,0,1,0,0],[0,0,0,1,1]]`
Output: `3`
