# Partition Equal Subset Sum Problem

## Problem Definition:
Given a non-empty array `nums` containing only positive integers, determine if you can partition the array into two subsets such that the sum of elements in both subsets is equal.

### Example 1:
**Input**: `nums = [1, 5, 11, 5]`  
**Output**: `true`  
**Explanation**: The array can be partitioned as `[1, 5, 5]` and `[11]`.  

### Example 2:
**Input**: `nums = [1, 2, 3, 5]`  
**Output**: `false`  
**Explanation**: The array cannot be partitioned into equal subsets.  

### Constraints:
- The array length will not exceed `200`.
- Each element in the array is a positive integer and will not exceed `100`.
