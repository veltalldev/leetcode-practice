# Problem: Count Paths in an N by M Matrix

## Problem Statement:
You are given an `N x M` matrix filled with zeroes. Write a function to count the number of ways to start at the top-left corner `(0, 0)` and get to the bottom-right corner `(N-1, M-1)`. You can only move **right** or **down** at each step.

### Example 1:
**Input**:
```plaintext
N = 2, M = 2
```
**Output**:
```plaintext
2
```
