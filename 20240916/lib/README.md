### Problem: Minimum Jumps to Reach the End of an Array

The problem asks for the minimum number of jumps required to reach the last index of an array, where each element in the array represents the maximum number of steps you can jump forward from that position.

### Approach:

This solution uses a **greedy algorithm** to solve the problem efficiently. The core idea is to always make the "best" possible jump at each step, ensuring that the number of jumps is minimized. Here's how the approach works:

1. **Greedy Strategy**:
   The problem exhibits characteristics that suggest a greedy approach. The choice of where to jump next does not affect previous choices. This implies that making the best decision at each step will lead to an optimal global solution.

2. **Evaluating Jump Options**:
   At each position, you can jump forward by a distance of `arr[i]`. However, instead of just choosing the first valid jump, the algorithm considers **all possible jumps** from that position. For each possible jump, the algorithm calculates how far the jump allows you to go, factoring in both the current jump and any further jumps it enables (i.e., how much additional reach it provides).

3. **Choosing the Best Jump**:
   For each valid jump from the current position, the algorithm calculates a "score," which is the sum of the jump step and the value at the landing position (`jumpStep + arr[current + jumpStep]`). This score represents how far ahead this jump can take you. The algorithm selects the jump that maximizes this score, as it provides the largest range of future options and, thus, is likely to minimize the total number of jumps.

4. **Termination Condition**:
   The algorithm terminates early if it finds a jump that directly lands at or beyond the last index. In that case, it increments the jump count and immediately returns the result.

5. **Efficiency**:
   The solution iterates through the array and considers each possible jump at each position. By greedily selecting the best jump, the algorithm ensures that it finds the minimum number of jumps without missing any optimal choices. This results in a time complexity of **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the array, as each element is processed once.

### Conclusion:

The greedy approach ensures that the minimum number of jumps is used to reach the end of the array. The key to the solution is evaluating all possible jump options from each position and always choosing the one that provides the maximum future reach.
