# Problem: Break String into Multiple Lines

## Problem Statement:
Given a string `s` and an integer `k`, break up the string into multiple lines such that:
- Each line has a length of `k` or less.
- Words don't break across lines.
- Each line should have the maximum possible number of words.
- If it's not possible to break the text up, return `null`.

### Assumptions:
- There are no spaces at the beginning or end of the string.
- There is exactly one space between each word.

### Example:
**Input**:
```plaintext
s = "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"
k = 10
```
**Output**:
```plaintext
["the quick", "brown fox", "jumps over", "the lazy", "dog"]
```
