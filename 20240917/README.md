### Pathfinding in a Binary Grid (Shortest Path)

Given an `m x n` binary grid where `0` represents open land and `1` represents obstacles, find the shortest path from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner. You can move up, down, left, or right. If no path exists, return -1.

#### Example:
Input: `grid = [[0,1],[0,0]]`
Output: `2`
