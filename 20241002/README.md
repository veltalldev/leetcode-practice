### Problem: Determine if a 32-bit Integer is a Power of Four

Given a 32-bit positive integer `N`, determine whether it is a power of four in faster than **O(log N)** time.

#### Constraints:
- `N` is a positive integer that fits within 32 bits.

#### Example:
- Input: `N = 16`
- Output: `true` (since 16 is \( 4^2 \))
  
- Input: `N = 8`
- Output: `false` (since 8 is not a power of four)

#### Requirements:
The solution should be faster than **O(log N)**.
