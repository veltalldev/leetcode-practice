# Problem: Generate the Power Set of a Set

## Problem Statement:
The **power set** of a set is the set of all its subsets, including the empty set and the set itself. Write a function that, given a set, generates its power set.

You may represent the set using a list or array.

### Example:
**Input**:
```plaintext
set = {1, 2, 3}
```
**Output**:
```plaintext
{{}, {1}, {2}, {3}, {1, 2}, {1, 3}, {2, 3}, {1, 2, 3}}
```
