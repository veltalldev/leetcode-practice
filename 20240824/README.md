# Problem: Find the Nearest K Points

## Problem Statement:
Given a list of points, a **central point**, and an integer `k`, write a function to find the **k** nearest points to the central point. The distance between two points is calculated using the **Euclidean distance** formula.

### Example 1:
**Input**:
```plaintext
points = [(0, 0), (5, 4), (3, 1)]
central_point = (1, 2)
k = 2
```
**Input**:
```plaintext
[(0, 0), (3, 1)]
```
