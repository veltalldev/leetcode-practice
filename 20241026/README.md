# Next Sparse Number Finder
## Problem Definition

Given a non-negative integer N, find the smallest sparse number that is greater than or equal to N.

### Background
A number is considered **sparse** if its binary representation contains no adjacent 1s. In other words, every pair of 1s in the binary representation must be separated by at least one 0.

Examples of sparse numbers:
- 21 (10101₂) is sparse because its 1s are separated by 0s
- 8 (1000₂) is sparse because it only has a single 1
- 5 (101₂) is sparse because its 1s are separated by a 0

Examples of non-sparse numbers:
- 22 (10110₂) is not sparse because it has two adjacent 1s
- 7 (111₂) is not sparse because all its 1s are adjacent
- 12 (1100₂) is not sparse because it has two adjacent 1s

### Requirements

1. **Input**:
   - A single non-negative integer N
   - N can be any non-negative integer within the valid integer range of the implementation language

2. **Output**:
   - The smallest sparse number greater than or equal to N
   - Must be returned as an integer

3. **Performance Constraint**:
   - The solution must run faster than O(N log N) time
   - Ideally, the solution should run in O(log N) time

### Examples

```
Input: N = 4
Output: 4
Explanation: 4 (100₂) is already sparse

Input: N = 38
Output: 40
Explanation: 38 (100110₂) is not sparse
             39 (100111₂) is not sparse
             40 (101000₂) is sparse

Input: N = 21
Output: 21
Explanation: 21 (10101₂) is already sparse
```

### Special Considerations

1. **Binary Pattern Recognition**:
   - Understanding how to identify adjacent 1s in binary representation
   - Recognizing patterns that make a number sparse or non-sparse

2. **Efficient Testing**:
   - Need to efficiently test if a number is sparse
   - Need to efficiently find the next potential sparse number

3. **Optimization Requirements**:
   - Must avoid checking every number between N and the result
   - Should utilize binary properties to skip non-viable candidates

### Edge Cases to Handle

1. Input is already a sparse number
2. Input is 0
3. Input requires carrying over multiple positions (like 7 → 8)
4. Large numbers close to the maximum integer value
5. Numbers with long sequences of adjacent 1s

### Problem-Solving Approaches

Several strategies could be considered:

1. **Bit Manipulation Approach**:
   - Examine binary representation directly
   - Use bitwise operations for efficiency
   - Look for patterns of adjacent 1s

2. **Pattern Recognition Approach**:
   - Understand that sparse numbers follow a pattern
   - Use this pattern to jump directly to the next sparse number
   - Avoid checking intermediate numbers

3. **Binary String Manipulation**:
   - Convert to binary string for easier pattern matching
   - Modify the string to ensure no adjacent 1s
   - Convert back to integer
   
### Key Skills Tested

This problem tests understanding of:
- Bit manipulation
- Binary number representation
- Algorithm optimization techniques
- Pattern recognition
- Time complexity analysis
- Edge case handling

### Solution Constraints

1. **Time Complexity**: Must be better than O(N log N)
2. **Space Complexity**: Should ideally be O(1) or O(log N)
3. **Correctness**: Must handle all possible input values within the integer range
4. **Efficiency**: Should avoid unnecessary iterations or checks
