## Problem: Valid Parentheses

Given a string containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:
1. Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
2. Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
3. Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.

**Examples:**
```
Input: "()"
Output: true

Input: "()[]{}"
Output: true

Input: "(]"
Output: false

Input: "([)]"
Output: false

Input: "{[]}"
Output: true
```
