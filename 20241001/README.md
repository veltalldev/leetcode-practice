# Longest Palindromic Subsequence Problem

## Problem Definition:
Given a string `s`, find the length of the longest subsequence that is a palindrome. You may delete characters from `s` to form the subsequence, but you cannot rearrange the order of the characters.

### Example 1:
**Input**:  
`s = "bbbab"`  
**Output**: `4`  
**Explanation**: One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bbbb", which has a length of 4.

### Example 2:
**Input**:  
`s = "cbbd"`  
**Output**: `2`  
**Explanation**: One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bb", which has a length of 2.

### Constraints:
- `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
- `s` consists only of lowercase English letters.
