# Problem: Implement a Stack API Using Only a Heap

**Objective**: Implement a **stack API** using only a **heap**. A stack follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle and implements the following methods:

- **`push(item)`**: Adds an element to the stack.
- **`pop()`**: Removes and returns the most recently added element, or throws an error if there is nothing on the stack.

---

## Reminder: Heap Operations

Recall that a **heap** supports the following operations:

- **`push(item)`**: Adds a new key to the heap.
- **`pop()`**: Removes and returns the **max** value of the heap.
