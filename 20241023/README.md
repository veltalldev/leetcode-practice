### Problem Statement

    Given a positive integer, find the next permutation of its digits in absolute order.
    The next permutation is defined as the next lexicographically greater arrangement of digits. 
    If the digits are already arranged in descending order, return the smallest possible 
    permutation (i.e., the digits arranged in ascending order).

    Example 1:
    Input: 48975
    Output: 49578

    Example 2:
    Input: 4321
    Output: 1234

    Your task is to write a function that takes an integer and returns the next permutation as an integer.
