### Problem: Find the Largest Contiguous Subarray Sum

This problem is about finding the largest sum of a contiguous subarray within a list of integers. The goal is to identify the subarray that yields the highest possible sum.

### Approach:

This solution uses a two-pointer approach to efficiently track subarrays and their corresponding sums. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initial Setup:**
   The algorithm begins by initializing several variables:
   - `maxSum`: Keeps track of the maximum sum found so far.
   - `runningSumLeft` and `runningSumRight`: These variables accumulate the sum of the subarrays as we expand from the left (`i`) and the right (`j`).
   - `i` and `j`: Pointers starting at the leftmost and rightmost indices of the array, respectively.

2. **Rolling Sum Strategy:**
   The approach starts by considering the widest possible subarray, stretching from `i = 0` (left) to `j = nums.length - 1` (right). As the algorithm progresses, it "rolls" (or contracts) the subarray by trimming either the left or right side, depending on which side contains the smaller value (`nums[i]` or `nums[j]`).

3. **Trimming Negative Sums:**
   If the rolling sum on either side (left or right) becomes negative, that sum is reset to 0. This is because negative sums would reduce the total sum of any subarray, so it is better to "trim" the subarray by discarding the negative part.

4. **Updating the Maximum Sum:**
   After each adjustment of the subarray (whether by moving the left pointer or the right pointer), the algorithm checks the current `runningSumLeft` and `runningSumRight`. It updates `maxSum` with the larger of these sums to ensure that the largest contiguous subarray sum is tracked.

5. **Termination:**
   The process continues until the two pointers (`i` and `j`) meet, at which point all possible subarrays have been considered, and the largest sum has been identified.

### Conclusion:

The algorithm efficiently finds the largest contiguous subarray sum by:
1. Expanding from both the left and right sides.
2. Trimming negative sums to prevent suboptimal subarrays.
3. Keeping track of the maximum sum as the subarray boundaries are adjusted.

The time complexity of this solution is linear, O(n), where `n` is the length of the input list, since the algorithm processes each element at most once.
