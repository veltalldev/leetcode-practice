### Follow-up Question 1:  
How would you optimize the solution if the size of the input array is significantly larger, for example, 100 or more elements?

### Follow-up Question 2:  
Can this problem be reduced to a known problem in computer science or mathematics? If yes, explain the reduction and the advantages it brings.

### Follow-up Question 3:  
What would be the impact of changing the target sum to a floating-point number? Would that change the approach, and how would you handle precision?

### Follow-up Question 4:  
Can you describe how you would modify your approach if some of the numbers in the input array were negative?

### Follow-up Question 5:  
How would the solution change if the numbers could repeat multiple times, and we needed to account for those repetitions when calculating the number of ways?

### Follow-up Question 6:  
What if the task was not just to count the number of ways but to return all the valid assignments of signs that sum to the target? How would you implement that?

### Follow-up Question 7:  
Can you describe how dynamic programming helps in solving this problem and how you would approach it iteratively rather than recursively?

### Follow-up Question 8:  
Could you discuss the space and time complexity of your solution? Is there any way to optimize either the space or time complexity further?

### Follow-up Question 9:  
How would you handle this problem if the target sum is not guaranteed to be within the constraints (for example, a target value beyond the bounds of the sum of the array)?

### Follow-up Question 10:  
What kind of real-world problems or applications can this target sum problem be applied to? Can you provide some examples?
