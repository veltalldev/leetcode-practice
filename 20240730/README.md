# Problem: Generate a Finite but Arbitrarily Large Binary Tree Quickly

## Problem Statement:
Implement a function `generate()` that generates a binary tree which is finite but **arbitrarily large**. The function should run in **O(1)** time. The size of the tree must be finite, but unbounded.

### Requirements:
- The tree should be finite but can grow arbitrarily large.
- The function `generate()` should run in **O(1)** time.
