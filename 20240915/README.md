# Smallest Set to Cover Intervals

## Problem Definition

### Objective
Given a set of closed intervals, determine the **smallest set of numbers** that intersects with all the intervals. In other words, find the fewest possible numbers such that every interval in the set contains at least one of those numbers. If there are multiple solutions, return any one of them.

### Example

Consider the following set of intervals:

`[0, 3], [2, 6], [3, 4], [6, 9]`

One possible smallest set of numbers that covers all these intervals is **{3, 6}**. 

### Explanation:
- The number `3` covers the intervals `[0, 3]`, `[2, 6]`, and `[3, 4]`.
- The number `6` covers the intervals `[2, 6]` and `[6, 9]`.

Thus, the set `{3, 6}` covers all intervals.

### Notes
- Each interval is represented as a pair of integers `[start, end]` where `start <= end`.
- The solution should return a set of integers such that each interval contains at least one number from the set.
- Multiple smallest sets may exist; returning any valid set is acceptable.
- The input intervals may overlap, but you must find the fewest possible points that intersect with all intervals.
