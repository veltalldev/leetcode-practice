### Problem: Find the Minimal Covering Set for Intervals

This problem involves finding the minimal set of points that "cover" a list of intervals. A point is considered to cover an interval if it lies within that interval.

### Approach:

The solution builds on the idea of sorting intervals by their right boundaries and systematically selecting representative points from those boundaries. Here's how the solution works step by step:

1. **Sorting the Intervals**:
   Intervals are first sorted by their right boundary. Sorting helps identify intervals that can intersect with others, allowing us to efficiently check which intervals are already covered by previously selected points.

2. **Maximal Intersection of Intervals**:
   The intervals are processed from left to right after sorting:
   - For each interval, we check whether it is already covered by a point that has been added to the covering set.
   - If not, we select its right boundary as the representative point to cover the interval. The rationale is that the right boundary maximizes the coverage of subsequent intervals.

3. **Identifying Non-Intersecting Intervals**:
   Before processing the intervals, a pre-processing step identifies non-intersecting intervals. This is done by checking if an interval cannot intersect with any other interval to its left. If the right boundary of an earlier interval is less than the left boundary of the current interval, the current interval is non-intersecting. For such intervals, a representative point is selected directly from their right boundary.

4. **Checking for Coverage**:
   The function `hasSetCoverage` is used to determine if an interval is already covered by a previously selected point. If a point exists in the set that lies within the bounds of the interval, the interval is considered covered.

5. **Handling Non-Intersecting Intervals**:
   Once the intersecting intervals are handled, any remaining non-intersecting intervals are processed, and their right boundaries are added to the covering set.

### Conclusion:

The algorithm works in two main phases:
1. Pre-processing to identify non-intersecting intervals.
2. Iterating through the sorted list of intervals to select representative points that cover all intervals.

By systematically selecting right boundaries for intervals, this approach ensures that the minimal number of points is chosen to cover all intervals, with an efficient time complexity of **O(n log n)** due to the sorting step.
