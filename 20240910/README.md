### Container with Most Water (Two Pointers)

Given `n` non-negative integers `height` where each represents a point at coordinate `(i, height[i])`, `n` vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of the line `i` are at `(i, 0)` and `(i, height[i])`.

Find two lines, which together with the x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

#### Example:
Input: `height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]`
Output: `49`
