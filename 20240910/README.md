# Deepest Node in a Binary Tree

## Problem Definition

### Objective
Given the root of a binary tree, find and return the **deepest node** in the tree. The deepest node is defined as the node that is farthest from the root. If multiple nodes share the same depth, return any one of the deepest nodes.

### Example

Consider the following binary tree:

```plaintext
    a
   / \
  b   c
 /
d
```

In this tree, the deepest node is **d**, which is at the greatest distance from the root.

### Notes
- Each node in the binary tree has a unique value.
- If the tree consists of a single node, that node is considered the deepest.
